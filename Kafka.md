# What is Kafka ?
 Apache Kafka is a **distributed streaming platform** used for building real-time data pipelines and applications, acting as a high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.

## What is DLT ?  
 DLT stands for Dead Letter Topic, means If a message is not able to consume by consumer it send to DLT.

### Modules
| Name| Description |
| - | - |
| **Producer** | Publish a Message/Events |
| **Consumer** | Consuming a Message/Events |
| **Broker** | Distributed System (Available in multiple servers) |
| **Cluster** | Kafka Server |
| **Topic** | Like Queue |
| **Partitions** | Spliting a Topic into multiple Partitions. |
| **Offset** | Index of the Messages called Offset number. |
| **Consumer Groups** | Grouping the Consumers. |
| **Zookeeper** | Managing a Kafka |

### Elaborated:-

| Producer | An application that publishes data (messages) to Kafka topics. It optimizes, serializes, and balances messages across partitions. |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Consumer** | An application that subscribes to Kafka topics and reads messages from partitions, typically within a consumer group. |
| **Broker** | A Kafka server that manages message storage and handles read/write requests. Brokers work together to form a Kafka cluster. |
| **Topic** | A logical channel that organizes messages. Producers write to topics, and consumers subscribe to them. |
| **Partition** | A sub-division of a topic that enables parallel processing. Each partition is replicated across brokers for fault tolerance. |
| **ZooKeeper / KRaft** | Coordinates and manages Kafka brokers and clusters, ensuring fault tolerance and leader elections for partitions. |
| **Replication** | Ensures copies of partitions are maintained across different brokers to enhance fault tolerance and availability. |
| **Consumer Group** | A group of consumers sharing the workload of processing messages from partitions of a topic, ensuring parallelism. |
| **Leader** | The broker responsible for handling all reads and writes for a partition. Each partition has one leader at any time. |
| **Follower** | Brokers that replicate data from the leader broker for redundancy and failover purposes. |
